I lerned during do the mileestones many of programming concepts.First ,I learned

the concept of inheritance which means that define class in another class that makes 

easier to maintain yor code and to reuse the code functionality.The main  purpose 

of inheritance is to create relationship between two classes in logical way.As we use

this concept in milestone we inherit from the class vehicle .Then I learned the different

types of inheritance when we inherit from public that means public inheritance that we 

can deal with it as public ,but when we inherit private data member that means private 

inheritance and we have to deal with it as private and when inherit from protected that 

you have to deal with it as protected inheritance .Also, I learned the difference

between abstract class and concreat class wich we deal with them in the milestones

The abstract class is a method but doesnot have implementation which means that

abstract class  can not be instantiated while the concrete class is a class have

an implementation of the abstrcat classs interface.Second,I enhance my understanding

to the oncept of polymorphism which means multiple use of the same function.In 

the context of the polymorphism and heriacery of classes I learned the concept 

of overloading which means use the same function name but different parameter

and the concept of overriding it is similar to to overloading but we use virtual

function in the derived class  and create instance of the derived class.In the 
 
end,The most part I faced difficulity was at car.cpp in the read function after

I print out the statement (carwash while paked?yes/no) here I find difficult 

in reading input and validate to y || n .
