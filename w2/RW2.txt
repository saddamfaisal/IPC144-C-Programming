   I learned from this workshop many of declaring data according to the giving requirements int and float data ,and I learned the input function by using printf

 and output function by using scanf .Also , the most important part I learned  was the arthematic operators division,multiply,remainder, and adding .

The difficult part was converting doubl to int till get the right output ,and how we can get rid of the zero by multiply by 100.The interesting part was 

casting because it help us  to more understand of the computations.The best practise to convert floating to int to be able to use the remainder because we

 can not use it wit floating numbers ,we use it just with integer.The best practise is to use moduel  operatotr instead of division and subtraction because 

modue operator does divide and give us the remainder  is more efficient because it does two operation gather.
