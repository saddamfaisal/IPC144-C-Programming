I learned from this workshop the use of # define macro defintion ,and how it is make our programing flexible we can increase or decline from this point.
I learned how I decleare structure which means that aset of  variables it could be  from one or different kind of data such as Int,double,and string.
Every variable inside the structure called member such as ID,Age,and salary we access the member by dot operator.
we can not assign inside the structure form ,we have to assign out of the structure frame.

The main points that I learned from this workshop how assign and leverage the flags and invalid value of record for example: delet member case
Also , I learn how we use it as   acondition to validate the output.for example the print out the table of employ Id ,age and salary.Then how to use the 
index to refer the required object.

In short,The efficient role of array of structure more useful than parallel arrays because we are not restricted with double arrays in limited size.
Also , when we declare a sructure just we know where is it location on the memory, but without allocate any size of the memory,so that will make it more efficient
in programming.In our code we declare the struct employee at home.cfile another place,but we can declare at header files the advantage of that we can make our code
more organized when we work with big programming cod that make our code more understanding to the reader.
