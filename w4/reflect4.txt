 I learned ftom this workshop how I can declare and initialize  arrays and parrallel arrays ,and why we use arrays and when?
Also, I learned how we can do iteration to get data inside the arrays and the way of access any element by index
 also how we use selections to exclude some data .

The arrays have many of the advantages .Arrays manage a huge sets of data from the same type ,and it could be from any type 
int,char,and double .There are different ways in use them .The main role of arrays   briefing our programming code and make 
it more flexible and understanding.Second, parallel arrays are useful for manage double tasks ,for instance, if we want to
 write programming code for make survey for student so we need to know about everystudent ID,and Name here we realize how 
parrallel arrays will be efficient.one of the negative sides  of using arrays that arrays have fixed size, so
 we could not increase the memory assigned.

The iteration is very important and helpful to use with arrays to loop the data that we need them to support our programming code
The best practise to initialize iteration variable to a value of zero because every array has begining point , so it is better to 
be the  zero starting point ,and it is more logic to start from zero to prevent any possible errors and because we start count from 
zero in array index.
